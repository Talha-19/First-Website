        <p>
            Hi! I'm Talha, and my passion lies in becoming a successful software developer. From a young age, I've been captivated by technology and solving complex problems. Today, I'm on a mission to become a successful software developer.<br><br>
            I spend my days mastering coding languages, taking on challenging projects, and collaborating with others. I believe that clear communication is just as important as technical skills, and I strive for excellence in both areas.
            <br><br>
            My goal is to create software that makes a positive impact on people's lives. I'm building a portfolio of innovative projects, and I'm excited about the journey ahead. Join me as I turn ideas into reality in the world of technology.

                <p class="summary">In this project, I wrote JavaScript functions to power a small guessing game where the user has to choose a number between 1-9 and the computer also randomly chooses a number. Whoever's guess is the closest to the target number wins.</p>

            <p class="summary">In this project, I created the classic Rock Paper and Scissors game. To play this game, the user must choose from the following: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Once the user has decided, it shows the computer's choice and decides the winner based on the two choices. If the user and the computer both choose the same option, the game ends in a draw.</p>
